          <h2>Architect (1887–1965)</h2>
          <p>
            Le Corbusier was a Swiss-born French architect who belonged to the
            first generation of the so-called International school of
            architecture.

        <h1>Le Corbusier</h1>
        <p>
          Le Corbusier was born Charles-Edouard Jeanneret-Gris in Switzerland on
          October 6, 1887. In 1917, he moved to Paris and assumed the pseudonym
          Le Corbusier.
        </p>
        <p>
          In his architecture, he chiefly built with steel and reinforced
          concrete and worked with elemental geometric forms. Le Corbusier's
          painting emphasized clear forms and structures, which corresponded to
          his architecture.

          Born Charles-Edouard Jeanneret-Gris on October 6, 1887, Le Corbusier
          was the second son of Edouard Jeanneret, an artist who painted dials
          in the town’s renowned watch industry, and Madame Jeannerct-Perrct, a
          musician and piano teacher. His family's Calvinism, love of the arts
          and enthusiasm for the Jura Mountains, where his family fled during
          the Albigensian Wars of the 12th century, were all formative
          influences on the young Le Corbusier. At age 13, Le Corbusier left
          primary school to attend Arts Décoratifs at La Chaux-de-Fonds, where
          he would learn the art of enameling and engraving watch faces,
          following in the footsteps of his father.
